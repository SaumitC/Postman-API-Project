# 📬 Postman API Testing Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with **API testing using Postman**, covering various request types, authentication mechanisms, and environment setups.

I tested **4 public APIs** to gain a strong understanding of:
- Different types of HTTP requests: **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**
- Response code types and handling
- Parameters (query, path, and body)
- Authentication types: **No Auth, Bearer Token**
- Manual runs and automated test cases
- Using **environment variables** and managing different environments in Postman

## 🔗 APIs Used

1. **Deck of Cards API**  
   👉 [https://deckofcardsapi.com/](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)  
   A fun API to simulate a deck of cards.

2. **Reqres API**  
   👉 [https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/)  
   A great tool for testing frontend against a mock REST API.

3. **Swagger BookStore API**  
   👉 [https://bookstore.demoqa.com/swagger/#/](https://bookstore.demoqa.com/swagger/#/)  
   Provides endpoints for managing books, users, and authentication.

   👉 [https://petstore.swagger.io/#/](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/)  
   A popular example API for practicing Swagger and OpenAPI documentation.

> 🔐 **Note:** Some requests (especially POST and DELETE) may require **API keys or Bearer tokens**, which you can obtain from the documentation links above.
